        <b>Introduction</b>
        <br>The implementation in this example is a post-hoc, model-agnostic interpretability 
        for both global and local model behaviour using

<dfn title =
"LIME is model-agnostic and provides local model interpretability which 
means that it modifies a single data sample by tweaking the feature values
 and observes the resulting impact on the output.
The output of LIME is a list of explanations, reflecting the contribution 
of each feature to the prediction of a data sample. 
This provides local interpretability, and it also allows to determine 
which feature changes will have most impact on the prediction. 
">LIME</dfn></span>. 
        Using the Kaggle’s Disaster Tweets NLP Challenge; we will interpret which words 
        contributed to the probability of a logistic regression model predicting a tweet 
        referring to a real disaster or not. The model will be trained solely on the text
        body of the tweet. 
        <br><b>How a LIME explanation is created</b>: 
        <li>1. First, you choose the single prediction which you would like explained
        <li>2. LIME creates permutations of your data at this instance and collects 
        the black-box model results
        <li>3. It then gives weights to the new samples based on how closely they 
        match the data of the original prediction
        <li>4. A new, less complex, interpretable model is trained on the data variations
        created using the weights attached to each variation
        <li>5. Finally, the prediction can be explained by this local interpretable model
